# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of the loan prediction risk analysis:

In this analysis the LendingClub, a lending service company, will have it's data reviewed through several machine learning algorithms. Each algorithm will then be evaluated to determine which is recommended to be used to predict credit risk. 

## Results:

There is a bulleted list that describes the balanced accuracy score and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models (15 pt)
